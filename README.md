#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## What have I done?

- I made the web-site responseive to various viewports, whether a tablet, phone or desktop.
- The web-site has the required accessibility.
- Focus is properly defined, so are the alt attributes for images.
- Aria and semantics are properly defined.
- The website is available offline.

## How can I access the web-site?
